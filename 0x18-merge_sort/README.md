# 0x18-merge_sort
This interview algorithm project utilizes the merge sort sorting algorithm.

[Merge Sort](/0x18-merge_sort/0-merge_sort.c)
* Write a function in C `void merge_sort(int *array, size_t size)` that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.
  * Implements the top-down merge sort algorithm
  * Can only use one call of malloc and one call of free
* Write in a text file, [0-O](/0x18-merge_sort/0-O), the Big O notations of the time complexity of the merge sort algorithm for best time, average time, and worst time.

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally and all given source code for reference.
