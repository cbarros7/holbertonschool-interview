# 0x0E. Linear search in skip list

```

- Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.
  - Prototype : `skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *list, int value)`;
  - Where list is a pointer to the head of the skip list to search in
  - A node of the express lane is placed every index which is a multiple of the square root of the size of the list (see example below)
  - And value is the value to search for
  - You can assume that list will be sorted in ascending order
  - Your function must return a pointer on the first node where value is located
  - If value is not present in list or if head is NULL, your function must return NULL
  - Every time you compare a value in the list to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)
