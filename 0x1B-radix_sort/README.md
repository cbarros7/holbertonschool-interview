# 0x1B-radix_sort
This interview algorithm project sorts an array of ints with radix sort, which sorts by each digit.

[Radix Sort](/0x1B-radix_sort/0-radix_sort.c)
* Write a function in C `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size)` that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using Radix Sort.
  * implements the Least Significant Digit radix sort algorithm
  * the array can be assumed to only contain non-negative ints
  * the algorithm prints the array each time the significant digit is increased

### test_files
The [test_files](/0x1B-radix_sort/test_files/) directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally and given source code to print an array.
